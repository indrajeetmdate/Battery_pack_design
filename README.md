ðŸ”§ Inputs (user-provided):
Application Type: EV / Stationary Storage

Expected Voltage (V)

Km Expected (for EV) or Backup Hours (for stationary)

Total Load (kW) (only for stationary)

Cell Type (optional) â€” suggest one if not provided

Available Space (mm): length, breadth, height



ðŸ“¤ Outputs:
Suggested Cell Name

Pack Voltage (V)

Cells in Series / Parallel

Pack Capacity (Ah), Energy (kWh)

Pack Weight & Volume

Volume Fit Status â€” does it fit in available space?

Pack Dimensions (Length Ã— Breadth Ã— Height in mm)



ðŸ“¦ Space Optimization Logic:
Prismatic:

      Length = Cell length Ã— Series
      
      Breadth = Cell breadth
      
      Height = Cell height Ã— Parallel

Cylindrical:

      Length = Diameter Ã— Series
      
      Breadth = (Diameter Ã— ceil(Parallel / Rows))
      
      Height = Cell height

Volume is verified as: Length Ã— Breadth Ã— Height â‰¤ Available Volume.
